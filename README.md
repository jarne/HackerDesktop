## 📙 Description

HackerDesktop is a fake hacker web app designed for fun, pranks, or cinematic flair. The main screen features a hacker code typer, simulating fast-paced terminal activity. Side windows include a faux port scanner that “scans” IP addresses with realistic-looking feedback, and a random number calculator to generate fake encryption keys or access codes. Perfect for role-play, streaming overlays, or feeling like a pro hacker with zero risk.
